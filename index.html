                I design my life<br> with intention,<br> discipline, and clarity.
            </h1>

            <p>
                This website is a quiet documentation of who I am, what I have built, and the path I chose over the last five years. Nothing here is loud. Everything here is intentional.
            </p>

            <p>
                I believe in long-term thinking, restraint, and creating value that does not need explanation.

            <p>
                I focus on mastery, consistency, and personal growth. Every decision I make is filtered through clarity, purpose, and responsibility.
